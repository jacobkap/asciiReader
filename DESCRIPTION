Description: Lets you open an 'SPSS' or 'SAS' data file using a .txt file that has the data and a .sps or .sas file with setup instructions. This will only run in a txt-sps or txt-sas pair in which the setup file contains instructions to open that text file. It will NOT open other text files, .sav, .por, or 'SAS' files.
