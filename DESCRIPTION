Version: 2.0.0
Authors@R: person("Jacob", "Kaplan", email = "jkkaplan6@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Lets you open a fixed-width ASCII file (.txt or .dat) that has
             an accompanying setup file (.sps or .sas).
             This will only run in a txt-sps or txt-sas pair in which the setup file contains instructions 
              to open that text file. It will NOT open other text files, .sav, .sas, or .por data files. 
              Fixed-width ASCII files with setup files are common in older (pre-2000) government data.
